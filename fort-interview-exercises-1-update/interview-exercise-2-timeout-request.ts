/*
 * Exercise 2
 *
 * In an existing Angular app, please implement a solution to ensure that any existing (or future) http requests made will
 * automatically timeout after 15 seconds as an error.
 *
 * You can assume that all requests will be made using Angular's HttpClient
 *
 * Please use the minimal out-of-the-box Angular app setup (ng new my-app) to provide the needed changes.
 * It is required that you use stackblitz or another "full app" online editor and send a link as your submission. This
 * should be a separate link apart from the other exercises. Submissions that do not use an online editor or are not separate
 * links will not be considered.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: all exercises are best effort. If you cannot arrive at the working solution requested, please just include an explanation
 * as to your approach, what worked, what didn't, and anything else you feel may be relevant.
